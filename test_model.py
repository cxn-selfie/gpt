# are relatively easy (for example, completing a word given the first few characters), meaning that large
# networks per-byte are unnecessary, and a much smaller model can be used for intra-patch modelling.
# M EGA B YTE has three main advantages over Transformers for long sequence modeling:
# 1. Sub-quadratic self-attention Most work on long sequence models has focused on mitigat-
# ing the quadratic cost of self-attention. M EGA B YTE decomposes long sequences into two
# 4
# shorter sequences, and optimal patch sizes reduces the self-attention cost to O(N 3 ), which
# remains tractable for even long sequences.
# 2. Per-patch feedforward layers In GPT3-size models, more than 98% of FLOPS are used in
# computing position-wise feedforward layers. M EGA B YTE uses large feedforward layers
# per-patch rather than per-position, enabling much larger and more expressive models for the
# same cost. With patch size P , where a baseline transformer would use the same feedforward
# layer with m parameters P times, M EGA B YTE can use a layer with mP parameters once
# for the same cost.
# 3. Parallelism in Decoding Transformers must perform all computations serially during
# generation because the input to each timestep is the output from the previous timestep. By
# reusing the global representation over multiple time steps during local model decoding,
# M EGA B YTE allows greater parallelism during generation. For example, a M EGA B YTE
# model with 1.5B parameters can generate sequences 40% faster than a standard 350M
# Transformer, whilst also improving perplexity when trained with the same compute.
# Together, these improvements allow us to train much larger and better-performing models for the same
# compute budget, scale to very long sequences, and improve generation speed during deployment.
# M EGA B YTE also provides a strong contrast to existing autoregressive models that typically use some
# form of tokenization, where sequences of bytes are mapped to larger discrete tokens (Sennrich et al.,
# 2015; Ramesh et al., 2021; Hsu et al., 2021). Tokenization complicates pre-processing, multi-modal
# modelling, and transfer to new domains, while hiding useful structure from the model. It also means
# that most state-of-the-art models are not truly end to end. The most widely used approaches to
# tokenization require language-specific heuristics (Radford et al., 2019) or lose information (Ramesh
# et al., 2021). Replacing tokenization with efficient and performant byte models would therefore have
# many advantages.
# We conduct extensive experiments for both M EGA B YTE and strong baselines. We use a fixed compute
# and data budget across all models to focus our comparisons solely on the model architecture rather
# than training resources, which are known to benefit all models. We find that M EGA B YTE allows
# byte-level models to perform competitively with subword models on long context language modeling,
# achieve state-of-the-art perplexities for density estimation on ImageNet, and allow audio modelling
# from raw audio files. Together, these results establish the viability of tokenization-free autoregressive
# sequence modeling at scale.

# M EGA B YTE Transformer
# 2.1 Overview
# M EGA B YTE is an autoregressive model for efficiently modeling long input sequences. M EGA B YTE
# is comprised of 3 components: (1) a patch embedder that inputs a discrete sequence, embeds each
# element, and chunks it into patches of length P (2) a large global Transformer that contextualizes patch
# representations by performing self-attention over previous patches, and (3) a smaller local Transformer
# that inputs a contextualized patch representation from the global model, and autoregressively predict
# the next patch.
# 2.2 Components
# Patch Embedder with patch size of P maps a byte sequence x0..T to a sequence of patch embeddings
# of length K = PT and dimension P · DG .
# First, each byte is embedded with a lookup table E global-embed ∈ RV ×DG to an embedding of size DG
# and positional embeddings are added.
# hembed
# = Exglobal-embed
# + Etpos
# t
# t
# t ∈ [0..T ]
# (1)
# Then, byte embeddings are reshaped into a sequence of K patch embeddings with dimension P · DG .
# To allow autoregressive modelling, the patch sequence is padded to start with a trainable patch-sized
# padding embedding (E global-pad ∈ RP ×DG ), and the last patch is removed from the input. This
# sequence is the input to the global model, and is denoted hglobal-in ∈ RK×(P ·DG ) .

# hembed
# ,
# k ∈ [1, .., K),
# ((k−1)·P ):(k·P )
# Global Model is a decoder-only Transformer with dimension P · DG that operates on a sequence of
# K patches. It incorporates a self-attention mechanism and causal masking to capture dependencies
# between patches. It inputs a sequence of K patch representations hglobal-in
# , and outputs an updated
# 0:K
# representation hglobal-out
# by
# performing
# self-attention
# over
# previous
# patches.
# 0:K
# hglobal-out
# = transformerglobal (hglobal-in
# )
# 0:K
# 0:K
# (3)
# The output of the final global layer hglobal
# 0:K contains K patch representations of dimension P · DG .
# For each of these, we reshape them into sequences of length P and dimension DG , where position p
# uses dimensions p · DG to (p + 1) · DG . Each position is then projected to the dimension of the local
# model with a matrix wGL ∈ RDG ×DL where DL is the local model dimension. We then combine
# these with byte embeddings of size DL for the tokens in the next patch Exlocal-embed
# . The local byte
# (k·P +p−1)
# embeddings is offset by one with a trainable local padding embedding (E local-pad ∈ RDL ) to allow
# autoregressive modelling within a patch. This results in a tensor hlocal-in ∈ RK×P ×DL .
# local-embed
# hlocal-in
# = wGL hglobal-out
# k,p
# k,(p·DG ):((p+1)·DG ) + Ex(k·P +p−1)
# (4)
# Local Model is a smaller decoder-only Transformer of dimension DL that operates on a single
# patch k containing P elements, each of which is the sum of an output from the global model and an
# embedding of the previous byte in the sequence. K copies of the local models are run on each patch
# independently (and in parallel during training), computing a representation hlocal-out ∈ RK×P ·DL .
# local local-in
# hlocal-out
# (hk,0:P )
# k,0:P = transformer
# (5)
# Finally, we can compute the probability distribution over the vocabulary at each position. The pth
# element of the kth patch corresponds to element t of the complete sequence, where t = k · P + p:
# p(xt |x0:t ) = softmax(E local-embed hlocal-out
# )x
# k,p

# t
# (6)2.3 Variations and Extensions
# Convolutional Patch Encoder: One limitation of patchifying sequences is that it is not translation
# invariant, and byte sequences may receive a different representation depending on their position in
# the patch. This may mean, for example, that a model has to relearn the meaning of a word at different
# offsets. To mitigate this issue, we experimented with augmenting the Patch Embedder with causal
# convolutional layers, which allow translation-invariant contextual representations of the bytes before
# they are chunked into patches. We use a stack of convolutional layers, with filter sizes of 3, 5 and 7.
# Cross-patch Attention: The Local model uses short sequences for efficiency, and relies on the
# Global model for long-range information. However, we can increase the context of the Local model
# with little overhead by allowing it to condition on r elements from the previous patch. This approach
# allows the Global model to focus on a longer-range context. Specifically, when computing self-
# attention in each layer, we concatenate the keys and values with the last r keys and queries from
# the previous patch. We use rotary embeddings (Su et al., 2021) to model relative positions between
# elements in the sequence. This approach is reminiscent of TransformerXL (Dai et al., 2019) but
# differs by being fully differentiable.
# Strided Inference: We observed empirically that the per-token loss within each patch increases
# towards the end of the patch, as the prediction relies more on the weaker Local model. To alleviate
# this issue, we propose strided inference, in which we predict the sequence with two forward passes of
# the full model, whose inputs are offset by p/2 positions from each other. We then combine the first
# p/2 positions in each patch for our predictions to predict the complete sequence. Similarly to sliding
# window methods (Press et al., 2020), this approach doubles the cost of inference but improves results.
# 3
# Efficiency Analysis
# 3.1 Training Efficiency
# Attention The cost of attention in a transformer architecture for a sequence of length T has O(T 2 )
# complexity. Much work has been explored reducing this; for example, Sparse Transformers (Child
# et al., 2019) and Routing Transformers (Roy et al., 2020) show strong results with a complexity
# 3
# O(T 2 ). Many linear attention mechanisms have also been proposed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020;
# Choromanski et al., 2020), although we are not aware of competitive results on large scale language
# modeling tasks. As a function of sequence length T and patch size P , the Global model has a sequence
# 2
# of length PT so uses O( PT 2 ) operations, and the Local model uses PT sequences of length P so uses
# 2
# 2
# O( TPP ) = O(P T ) operations. The overall cost of M EGA B YTE is therefore in O( PT 2 + T P ). P is a
# 1
# hyperparameter that is chosen to create an architecture for sequences of size T . By setting P = T 3
# 4
# 1
# the complexity is in O(T 3 ). Using much shorter patches of P = T 5 would give a complexity of
# 8
# O(T 5 ). The cost is less than the transformer for all non-trivial values of P such that 1 < P < T .
# Feedforward Layers However, attention is not the main cost in large transformers. Instead of
# increasing the sequence length, transformers are more commonly scaled by increasing the dimension
# of their latent state d, and the feedforward network cost dominates the model’s overall cost (Kaplan
# et al., 2020). For example, in the GPT3 architecture, the quadratic self-attention computation accounts
# for only 1.4% of FLOPS. Following the approximation of (Kaplan et al., 2020), a forward pass with
# a large transformer with m non-embedding parameters on a sequence of length T uses roughly
# 2mT FLOPS. M EGA B YTE contains two transformers: the Global model uses mg parameters on a
# sequence of length PT , and a Local model with ml parameters that sees PT sequences of length P ,

# giving an estimate of 2T ( Pg + ml ) FLOPS. When mg ≫ ml , the FLOPS used by M EGA B YTE is
# 2T m
# approximately P g , allowing a model P times larger than a transformer with equivalent FLOPS.
# This analysis holds irrespective of any efficient attention mechanisms used in the transformer.
# Combined Analysis To understand efficiency at different sequence lengths and model sizes,
# we calculate the total FLOPS used by transformers, Linear Transformers and M EGA B YTE. For
# each operation, we use FLOP estimates from (Kaplan et al., 2020), except for attention in Linear
# Transformers, which we estimate as 9D FLOPS/token1 , where D is the model embedding dimension.
# Figure 3 shows that for models of size 660M to 173B and sequence lengths of up to 1M tokens,
# 1
# This may underestimate the time taken by Linear Transformer decoders, which use a recurrence mechanism
# that is harder to parallelize on current hardware.
# 4M EGA B YTE with P = 8 uses less FLOPS than either transformers or Linear Transformers. Baseline
# model architectures are based on GPT3, and Megabyte global/local model sizes are 452M/151M,
# 5.8B/604M, 170B/3.2B respectively.
# 3.2
# Generation Efficiency
# Generating long sequences with transformers is
# slow, because the input to each timestep is the
# output from the previous timestep, meaning each
# layer must be computed for each token serially.
# As running a layer on a single token typically
# does not saturate the amount of parallelism avail-
# able within a GPU, for analysis, we model each
# layer as a constant cost independently of size.
# Consider a M EGA B YTE model with Lglobal lay-
# ers in the Global model and Llocal layers in the
# Local model and patch size P , compared with
# a Transformer architecture with Llocal + Lglobal
# layers. Generating each patch with M EGA B YTE
# requires a sequence of O(Lglobal + P · Llocal )
# serial operations, whereas the Transformer re-
# quires O(P ·Lglobal +P ·Llocal ) serial operations.
# When Lglobal ≫ Llocal (i.e. the Global model
# has many more layers than the Local model),
# M EGA B YTE can reduce inference costs by a
# factor close to P .
# 4
# Figure 3: Computational cost (FLOPS/token) for differ-
# ent model architectures at different scales. M EGA B YTE
# architectures (here with P = 8) use less FLOPS than
# equivalently sized Transformers and Linear Transform-
# ers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) across a wide range of
# model sizes and sequence lengths, allowing larger mod-
# els to be used for the same computational cost.
# Experimental setup
# Controlling for Compute and Data Models show consistent improvements when increasing
# both data and compute Kaplan et al. (2020); Hoffmann et al. (2022), meaning that one model can
# outperform another because of an increased training budget instead of an improved architecture.
# However, in practice, both compute and data are typically limited. We conduct experiments using a
# fixed compute and data budget across all models to focus comparisons solely on the model architecture
# rather than training resources. To achieve this, we adjust model hyperparameters (mainly, number of
# layers) within each architecture so that the forward pass time taken per byte is matched, and then
# train all models for the same number of bytes.
# Comparison Systems We compare M EGA B YTE with both a standard decoder-only Transformer
# and PerceiverAR (Hawthorne et al., 2022). PerceiverAR extends the original transformer with a
# single cross-attention layer over a much longer context sequence, and is the best performing general
# purpose autoregressive model we are aware of and achieves state-of-the-art results across several
# modalities. We implemented both models in the same codebase, and all models share a similar data
# loader, preprocessing step, and trainer to avoid any artifacts in our compute-controlled experiments.
# Training Procedure All models were trained using the Metaseq2 code base Zhang et al. (2022b).
# The training used the PyTorch framework Paszke et al. (2019), with fairscale to improve memory
# efficiency through fully sharded model and optimizer states Baines et al. (2021). Mixed precision
# training was used to improve training efficiency at scale Micikevicius et al. (2017). More training
# details and various model parameters can be found in Section A.1 in the Appendix. To validate
# our implementation of PerceiverAR, we reproduced their experiments on downsized ImageNet at
# 64 pixels. By carefully matching hyperparameters, we achieved a bits per byte (bpb) score of 3.53,
# compared to the reported 3.54 in the original paper.
# Inference Methods Several techniques have been proposed for trading off speed for performance
# during inference with language models, including sliding windows Press et al. (2020) and our strided
# inference. We only use these methods when comparing with prior published work (Tables 2 and 3).

# Language Modeling
# We evaluated the performance of M EGA B YTE on language modeling on a set of 5 diverse datasets
# emphasizing long-range dependencies: Project Gutenberg (PG-19), Books, Stories, arXiv, and Code.
# Datasets We experiment on a range of long form text datasets. The PG-19 dataset Rae et al. (2019b)
# consists of English-language books written before 1919 and is extracted from the Project Gutenberg
# online library. The Stories dataset Trinh & Le (2018) is a subset of CommonCrawl data meant to
# emulate Winograd schemas. Books Gao et al. (2020) is another collection of English-language books.
# The arXiv dataset contains technical publications written in LATEX from the arXiv online archive.
# Finally, the Code dataset is a large publicly available dataset of open source code, under Apache,
# BSD or MIT licenses. More details on dataset sizes and document lengths are shared in Table 1.
# Controlled Experiments Table 1 lists bpb on each dataset. Each model is trained for 80 billion bytes,
# and models are scaled to use the same compute budget. We carefully tune hyperparameters for all
# architectures to best utilize the available compute budget. M EGA B YTE consistently outperforms both
# transformers and PerceiverAR across all datasets. We use the same sets of parameters on all dataset.
# In all experiments presented in Table 1, transformer has size of 320M with context length of 1024,
# PerceiverAR has size of 248M with context size of 8192 and latent size of 1024, and M EGA B YTE
# global/local model sizes are 758M/262M with context length of 8192 and patch size of 8.
# Scaling Experiment We scale up our training data on PG-19 (Table 2), and compare M EGA B YTE
# with byte baselines, as well as converting all results to word-level perplexities to benchmark with state-
# of-art token based models. We train a byte-level Transformer, PerceiverAR and M EGA B YTE models
# for 400B bytes and the same compute budget using same model parameters as in the controlled
# experiments. We find that M EGA B YTE outperforms other byte-level models by a wide margin
# at this scale.3 We also compare with the best previously reported numbers for sub-word models.
# These results may be confounded by differing amounts of compute and tuning used, but show that
# M EGA B YTE gives results competitive with state-of-the-art models trained on subwords. These results
# suggest that M EGA B YTE may allow future large language models to be tokenization-free.

# Image Modeling
# Sequence Modeling on ImageNet We test M EGA B YTE on variants of the autoregressive image
# generation task on ImageNet (Oord et al., 2016), to measure its ability to efficiently use long context.
# We test on three different resolutions of images, ranging from 64×64 to 640×640 pixels – the latter
# 3
# The only prior byte-level experiments we are aware of are at a smaller scale in Hutchins et al. (2022), who
# report results equivalent to test perplexities of 46.5 with a version of the BlockRecurrent transformer, and 49.5
# with Memorizing Transformers Wu et al. (2022), compared to 36.4 with our model.
# 6requiring the effective modeling of sequences with over 1.2M tokens. This generation task becomes
# increasingly challenging as the image’s resolution grows: doing well on this task requires the modeling
# of local patterns (textures, lines, etc.) and long-range context that provides information about the
# high level structure of the image. Inspired by recent works in Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al.,
# 2020), we model image data patch by patch (more details can be found in Appendix D.1).
# Comparison with State of the Art We train a large M EGA B YTE model on ImageNet 64x64 with
# Global and Local models sized 2.7B and 350M parameters, respectively, for 1.4T tokens. We estimate
# that training this model consumed less than half the GPU hours we would have needed to reproduce
# the best PerceiverAR model described by (Hawthorne et al., 2022). As shown in Table 2, M EGA B YTE
# matches the state-of-the-art performance of PerceiverAR whilst using only half the compute.

# MEGABYTE scales well to sequences of over 1M tokens.
# Scaling to higher resolutions We compare three transformer variants (vanilla, PerceiverAR,
# M EGA B YTE) to test scalability to long sequences on increasingly large image resolutions. We use
# our own implementations of these in the same framework and budget the same amount of GPU hours
# and data to train each of these model variants.
# M EGA B YTE is able to handle all sequence lengths with a single forward pass of up to 1.2M tokens.
# We found neither the standard Transformer nor PerceiverAR could model such long sequences
# at a reasonable model size, so instead we split images into segments of size 1024 and 12000
# respectively. For Megabyte, we set patch size as 12 for Image64 and patch size as 192 for Image256
# and Image640 datasets. Model sizes are adjusted to match overall training speeds across models
# and we do not use any form of sliding window evaluation in this experiment. As seen in Table 4,
# M EGA B YTE outperforms baselines across all resolutions in this compute-controlled setting. The
# precise settings used for each of the baseline models such as context length and number of latents
# are summarized in Table 12. Results show that M EGA B YTE outperforms the other systems at all
# resolutions, demonstrating an effective model of sequences of over 1M bytes.

# Audio Modeling
# Audio has aspects of both the sequential structure of text and the continuous nature of images, so is
# an interesting application for M EGA B YTE.
# Raw audio is typically stored as a sequence of 16-bit integer values (one per timestep); a softmax layer
# would need to output 65,536 probabilities per timestep to model all possible values. To address this
# issue, various techniques have been developed to reduce the memory and computational requirements
# of the softmax layer. For instance, van den Oord et al. (2016) apply µ-law companding transformation
# and quantizes the input into 256 possible values. Alternatively, van den Oord et al. (2017) model the
# samples using the discretized mixture of logistics distribution introduced by Salimans et al. (2017).
# Finally, Kalchbrenner et al. (2018) use a dual softmax technique to produce 8 coarse and 8 fine bits.
# In our approach, we simplify the audio modeling process by directly reading the bytes (256 possible
# values) from the audio file and conducting an autoregressive language model on top of that. This
# greatly streamlines the modeling process, making it easier and more efficient.
# Our audio modeling approach focuses on 16 kHz, 16-bit audio, which equates to 32k bytes per
# one-second clip. We use an extensive audio dataset consisting of 2 terabytes (roughly 18,000 hours)
# of audio. We use a sequence length of 524,288, a patch size of 32, and a batch size of 32 to facilitate
# model training. By utilizing these settings, we can effectively train our model on large volumes of
# audio data, helping to improve its accuracy and efficacy. Our model obtains bpb of 3.477, much

# Analysis
# We study different behaviors of M EGA B YTE. All experiments in the same group use the same
# compute.
# Generation speed We also compare the text generation speed between M EGA B YTE and a trans-
# former. We compare a 350M parameter baseline transfomer and a M EGA B YTE model with a 1.3B
# parameter Global model and a 218M parameter local model, trained on PG19 with equal compute.
# As shown in Table 5, the M EGA B YTE model achieves much lower perplexity as expected. However,
# M EGA B YTE also generates a sequence of 8192 tokens 40% faster than transformer, despite having
# over 4 times the parameters. This speed up is due to the bulk of the parameters being in the Global
# model, which only needs to be computed once for every 8 tokens, whereas all the parameters in the
# baseline model are used on every token.
# Model Components In Table 6, we analyze the significance of different components in the
# M EGA B YTE architecture by studying arXiv, Librilight-L and ImageNet256 datasets. Removing Local
# (w/o local model) or global (w/o global model) model, we observe a substantial increase in bpb on all
# datasets, showing that both parts are crucial. The performance of the model without the cross-patch
# local model (w/o cross-patch local model) is competitive, indicating that the architecture is robust to
# this modification. We observe slight improvement on the Librilight-L and ImageNet256 datasets by
# augmenting the M EGA B YTE model with a CNN encoder (w/ CNN encoder). This suggests that the
# M EGA B YTE architecture can benefit from integrating alternative encoding mechanisms.
# Effective Use of Context Long-context models often struggle to benefit from the full context (Sun
# et al., 2021). Figure 7 shows that later tokens within each context window have a higher likelihood,
# indicating that M EGA B YTE can effectively use at least 8k bytes of context on the PG19 dataset.

# Table 9: Performance of various inference tech-

# M EGA B YTE model.Strided Inference We find that within a single patch, on average, the M EGA B YTE performs worse
# on later tokens within a patch (see Figure 8). Section 2.3 proposes strided inference as a solution,
# where two forward passes are performed offset by P2 tokens, and results from the first half of each
# patch are combined. Table 9 shows performance improvements from strided inference, which are
# additive with the standard sliding window.
# Patch Size. We experimented with various patch sizes on Image256 dataset and found a wide range
# of values where M EGA B YTE performs similarly. We found similar robustness to patch size choices
# across all modalities, although the optimal patch size itself can be different across modalities.
# Local to Global model Size Ratio. We experimented with different Local/Global model size ratios
# on PG19 dataset. By grouping bytes into patches, M EGA B YTE effectively uses P times less tokens
# for the Global model as on the Local model—enabling us to increase the size of the Global model
# with reduced cost. We find that a given compute budget is spent optimally when the Global model is
# larger than the Local model, consistently across all modalities and various patch sizes.

# Related Work
# Prior research has explored the possibility of improving the efficiency of Transformers on long
# sequences, primarily motivated by mitigating the quadratic cost of self-attention.
# Efficient Encoder Models Several related techniques to ours have been developed for transformer
# encoder architectures but cannot be straightforwardly applied to decoders. In particular, patchifying
# operations have previously been used in image encoder models such as ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020),
# and down- and up-sampling operations have been used for text encoders (Clark et al., 2022), but such
# methods cannot be naively applied to decoder-only models without leaking information to future
# bytes in the same patch. M EGA B YTE generalizes these approaches to an efficient decoder model
# by using a intra-patch transformer to predict each sequence element’s likelihood, and offseting the
# inputs to the two models to avoid leaking information. Jaegle et al. (2021) use self-attention on a
# shorter latent sequence also resembles patchification, but this technique cannot easily be applied to
# decoder architectures without leaking information to future timesteps.
# Efficient Decoder models Improving the efficiency of decoder models is harder because of the need
# to make one prediction per timestep, and not leak information to future timesteps. The most popular
# approaches can be categorized as (1) chunking sequences into smaller blocks, and propagating
# information from previous blocks with either recurrence (Dai et al., 2019; Hutchins et al., 2022) or
# cross-attention (Hawthorne et al., 2022), (2) linear alternatives to attention, which typically involve
# forms of token-level recurrence (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) or state space models (Gu et al., 2021;
# Smith et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022), or (3) sparse approximations of attention (Kitaev et al., 2020;
# Beltagy et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2022). However, the performance of dense attention
# means it is typically still chosen for large scale decoders (Touvron et al., 2023; Chowdhery et al.,
# 2022). M EGA B YTE takes the alternative approach of decomposing the complete sequence into two
# shorter sequences, giving sub-quadratic attention. We also note that feedforward networks are the
# dominant cost in large decoders, not self-attention. Our approach to compressing sequences allows
# much larger models than would be possible when using large feedforward networks at every timestep.
# Tokenization The most common approach to shortening sequence lengths in Transformer decoders is
# to pre-process the input with a form of tokenization, in which multiple bytes are mapped to a single
# discrete token from a fixed vocabulary. For text, this can be done losslessly using methods such as
# BPE (Sennrich et al., 2015) and SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018), but these approaches can
# require language-specific heuristics (Radford et al., 2019), limit out-of-domain performance (Sharami
# 9et al., 2023), and can affect prompting and truncated sampling in unpredictable ways.4 The amount
# of high-frequency information in images and audio means that tokenization cannot be performed
# losslessly, and instead clustering (Hsu et al., 2021) or discrete auto-encoders (Ramesh et al., 2021) are
# used to compress the inputs, which lose information and likely limit generative model performance.
# Our patches are analogous to traditional lossless tokens, and the Local model performs the role of
# mapping a hidden state to a distribution over possible patches.
# 10
# Conclusion
# We introduced M EGA B YTE, a scaleable architecture for modeling long sequences. M EGA B YTE
# outperforms existing byte-level models across a range of tasks and modalities, allowing large models
# of sequences of over 1 million tokens. It also gives competitive language modeling results with
# subword models, which may allow byte-level models to replace tokenization. However, the scale
# of experiments here is far below those of state-of-the-art language models (Brown et al., 2020), and
# future work should explore scaling M EGA B YTE to much larger models and datasets.

# A.1Training Details
# To ensure stable training, we applied gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 and used the
# Adam optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 Kingma & Ba (2015). We used the built-in polynomial
# decay learning rate scheduler in MetaSeq with 500 warmup updates and the end learning rate set
# to 0. All models are trained with pre-norm and using ReLU activation. We apply a dropout of 0.1
# throughout, but we do not apply any dropout to embeddings. We also use weight decay of 0.1. To
# initialize the weights, we use a variant based on Megatron-LM codebase, which involves using a
# normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 0.006. We truncate this normal
# distribution within two standard deviations and observed substantial gain in both training stability
# and performance.
# A.2
# Motivation
# Why is the local model needed? Many of the efficiency advantages of the M EGA B YTE design could
# be realized with the Global model alone, which would resemble a decoder version of ViT (Dosovitskiy
# et al., 2020). However, the joint distribution over the patch p(xt+1 , .., xt+P |x0..t ) has an output space
# of size 256P so direct modeling is only tractable for very small patches. We could instead factor
# the joint distribution into conditionally independent distributions p(xt+1 |x0..t )..p(xt+P |x0..t ), but
# this would greatly limit the model’s expressive power. For example, it would be unable to express
# a patch distribution such as 50% cat and 50% dog, and would instead have to assign probability
# mass to strings such as cag and dot. Instead, our autoregressive Local model conditions on previous
# characters within the patch, allowing it to only assign probability to the desired strings.
# Increasing Parameters for Fixed Compute Transformer models have shown consistent improve-
# ments with parameter counts (Kaplan et al., 2020). However, the size of models is limited by their
# increasing computational cost. M EGA B YTE allows larger models for the same cost, both by mak-
# ing self attention sub-quadratic, and by using large feedforward layers across patches rather than
# individual tokens.
# Re-use of Established Components M EGA B YTE consists of two transformer models interleaved
# with shifting, reshaping and a linear projection. This re-use increases the likelihood that the architec-
# ture will inherit the desirable scaling properties of transformers.
# A.3
# Model Details
# As discussed in Section 4, we conduct experiments using a fixed compute and data budget across all
# models to focus our comparisons solely on the model architecture rather than training resources. To
# achieve this, we adjust model hyperparameters within each architecture so that the time taken for a
# single update is matched and then train all models for the same number of updates. We list all of
# model details in Table 12 and Table 13.

# PerceiverAR Implementation
# To reproduce PerceiverAR in a compute-controlled setting we extended the standard transformer
# implementation in metaseq with an additonal cross attention layer to compute the latents and match
# the architecture of PerceiverAR. We trained the model by sampling random spans from each text,
# matching the procedure used in the PerceiverAR codebase. To be consistent with the original work,
# we use sliding window evaluation with a stride of num_latents/2 unless otherwise noted. In several
# cases we used the standard metaseq implementation as opposed to specific techniques reported in
# the original paper: 1) we used standard attention dropout instead of cross-attention dropout 2) We
# did not implement chunked attention. We verified our implementation by reproducing the "Standard
# Ordering" experiments in Table 5 of the Perceiver AR paper. After carefully matching context size,
# number of latents, the amount of data and training steps used and learning rate, we achieved 3.53 bpb
# vs 3.54 reported in the original paper.
# DMore results
# D.1Patch scan Implementation
# Images have a natural structure, containing a grid of n × n pixels each composed of 3 bytes
# (corresponding to color channels). We explore two ways of converting images to sequences for
# modeling (see Figure 4). Firstly, raster scan where the pixels are linearized into 3 bytes and
# concatenated row-by-row. Secondly, patch scan where we create patches of shape p × p × 3 bytes
# 15Figure 4: Two ways to model 2D data sequentially. Left, raster scan, by taking bytes row by row and left to
# right; right, patch scan, where we first split an image into patches, and do raster scan across patches and within a
# patch. (T=36, K=9, P=4).
# q
# P
# where p =
# 3 , and then use a raster scan both within and between patches. Unless otherwise
# specified, M EGA B YTE models use patch scan for image data.
# D.2
# Patch scan vs Raster scan
# The patch scan method is inspired by recent works in Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020),
# and it is more effective than raster scan for modeling image sequencing. We found it improves both
# M EGA B YTE and Perceiver AR.

# Introduction
# Sequences of millions of bytes are ubiquitous;
# for example, music, image, or video files typi-
# cally consist of multiple megabytes. However,
# large transformer decoders (LLMs) typically
# only use several thousand tokens of context
# (Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022a)—both
# because of the quadratic cost of self-attention
# but also, more importantly, the cost of large feed-
# forward networks per-position. This severely
# limits the set of tasks where LLMs can be ap-
# plied.

# and DL , and K patches of size P . Transformer layers use masked self attention to not observe future timesteps.
# are relatively easy (for example, completing a word given the first few characters), meaning that large
# networks per-byte are unnecessary, and a much smaller model can be used for intra-patch modelling.
# M EGA B YTE has three main advantages over Transformers for long sequence modeling:
# 1. Sub-quadratic self-attention Most work on long sequence models has focused on mitigat-
# ing the quadratic cost of self-attention. M EGA B YTE decomposes long sequences into two
# 4
# shorter sequences, and optimal patch sizes reduces the self-attention cost to O(N 3 ), which
# remains tractable for even long sequences.
# 2. Per-patch feedforward layers In GPT3-size models, more than 98% of FLOPS are used in
# computing position-wise feedforward layers. M EGA B YTE uses large feedforward layers
# per-patch rather than per-position, enabling much larger and more expressive models for the
# same cost. With patch size P , where a baseline transformer would use the same feedforward
# layer with m parameters P times, M EGA B YTE can use a layer with mP parameters once
# for the same cost.
# 3. Parallelism in Decoding Transformers must perform all computations serially during
# generation because the input to each timestep is the output from the previous timestep. By
# reusing the global representation over multiple time steps during local model decoding,
# M EGA B YTE allows greater parallelism during generation. For example, a M EGA B YTE
# model with 1.5B parameters can generate sequences 40% faster than a standard 350M
# Transformer, whilst also improving perplexity when trained with the same compute.
# Together, these improvements allow us to train much larger and better-performing models for the same
# compute budget, scale to very long sequences, and improve generation speed during deployment.
# M EGA B YTE also provides a strong contrast to existing autoregressive models that typically use some
# form of tokenization, where sequences of bytes are mapped to larger discrete tokens (Sennrich et al.,
# 2015; Ramesh et al., 2021; Hsu et al., 2021). Tokenization complicates pre-processing, multi-modal
# modelling, and transfer to new domains, while hiding useful structure from the model. It also means
# that most state-of-the-art models are not truly end to end. The most widely used approaches to
# tokenization require language-specific heuristics (Radford et al., 2019) or lose information (Ramesh
# et al., 2021). Replacing tokenization with efficient and performant byte models would therefore have
# many advantages.
# We conduct extensive experiments for both M EGA B YTE and strong baselines. We use a fixed compute
# and data budget across all models to focus our comparisons solely on the model architecture rather
# than training resources, which are known to benefit all models. We find that M EGA B YTE allows
# byte-level models to perform competitively with subword models on long context language modeling,
# achieve state-of-the-art perplexities for density estimation on ImageNet, and allow audio modelling
# from raw audio files. Together, these results establish the viability of tokenization-free autoregressive
# sequence modeling at scale.

# M EGA B YTE Transformer
# 2.1 Overview
# M EGA B YTE is an autoregressive model for efficiently modeling long input sequences. M EGA B YTE
# is comprised of 3 components: (1) a patch embedder that inputs a discrete sequence, embeds each
# element, and chunks it into patches of length P (2) a large global Transformer that contextualizes patch
# representations by performing self-attention over previous patches, and (3) a smaller local Transformer
# that inputs a contextualized patch representation from the global model, and autoregressively predict
# the next patch.
# 2.2 Components
# Patch Embedder with patch size of P maps a byte sequence x0..T to a sequence of patch embeddings
# of length K = PT and dimension P · DG .
# First, each byte is embedded with a lookup table E global-embed ∈ RV ×DG to an embedding of size DG
# and positional embeddings are added.
# hembed
# = Exglobal-embed
# + Etpos
# t
# t
# t ∈ [0..T ]
# (1)
# Then, byte embeddings are reshaped into a sequence of K patch embeddings with dimension P · DG .
# To allow autoregressive modelling, the patch sequence is padded to start with a trainable patch-sized
# padding embedding (E global-pad ∈ RP ×DG ), and the last patch is removed from the input. This
# sequence is the input to the global model, and is denoted hglobal-in ∈ RK×(P ·DG ) .

# k ∈ [1, .., K),
# ((k−1)·P ):(k·P )
# Global Model is a decoder-only Transformer with dimension P · DG that operates on a sequence of
# K patches. It incorporates a self-attention mechanism and causal masking to capture dependencies
# between patches. It inputs a sequence of K patch representations hglobal-in
# , and outputs an updated
# 0:K
# representation hglobal-out
# by
# performing
# self-attention
# over
# previous
# patches.
# 0:K
# hglobal-out
# = transformerglobal (hglobal-in
# )
# 0:K
# 0:K
# (3)
# The output of the final global layer hglobal
# 0:K contains K patch representations of dimension P · DG .
# For each of these, we reshape them into sequences of length P and dimension DG , where position p
# uses dimensions p · DG to (p + 1) · DG . Each position is then projected to the dimension of the local
# model with a matrix wGL ∈ RDG ×DL where DL is the local model dimension. We then combine
# these with byte embeddings of size DL for the tokens in the next patch Exlocal-embed
# . The local byte
# (k·P +p−1)
# embeddings is offset by one with a trainable local padding embedding (E local-pad ∈ RDL ) to allow
# autoregressive modelling within a patch. This results in a tensor hlocal-in ∈ RK×P ×DL .
# local-embed
# hlocal-in
# = wGL hglobal-out
# k,p
# k,(p·DG ):((p+1)·DG ) + Ex(k·P +p−1)
# (4)
# Local Model is a smaller decoder-only Transformer of dimension DL that operates on a single
# patch k containing P elements, each of which is the sum of an output from the global model and an
# embedding of the previous byte in the sequence. K copies of the local models are run on each patch
# independently (and in parallel during training), computing a representation hlocal-out ∈ RK×P ·DL .
# local local-in
# hlocal-out
# (hk,0:P )
# k,0:P = transformer
# (5)
# Finally, we can compute the probability distribution over the vocabulary at each position. The pth
# element of the kth patch corresponds to element t of the complete sequence, where t = k · P + p:
# p(xt |x0:t ) = softmax(E local-embed hlocal-out
# )x

# (6)2.3 Variations and Extensions
# Convolutional Patch Encoder: One limitation of patchifying sequences is that it is not translation
# invariant, and byte sequences may receive a different representation depending on their position in
# the patch. This may mean, for example, that a model has to relearn the meaning of a word at different
# offsets. To mitigate this issue, we experimented with augmenting the Patch Embedder with causal
# convolutional layers, which allow translation-invariant contextual representations of the bytes before
# they are chunked into patches. We use a stack of convolutional layers, with filter sizes of 3, 5 and 7.
# Cross-patch Attention: The Local model uses short sequences for efficiency, and relies on the
# Global model for long-range information. However, we can increase the context of the Local model
# with little overhead by allowing it to condition on r elements from the previous patch. This approach
# allows the Global model to focus on a longer-range context. Specifically, when computing self-
# attention in each layer, we concatenate the keys and values with the last r keys and queries from
# the previous patch. We use rotary embeddings (Su et al., 2021) to model relative positions between
# elements in the sequence. This approach is reminiscent of TransformerXL (Dai et al., 2019) but
# differs by being fully differentiable.
# Strided Inference: We observed empirically that the per-token loss within each patch increases
# towards the end of the patch, as the prediction relies more on the weaker Local model. To alleviate
# this issue, we propose strided inference, in which we predict the sequence with two forward passes of
# the full model, whose inputs are offset by p/2 positions from each other. We then combine the first
# p/2 positions in each patch for our predictions to predict the complete sequence. Similarly to sliding
# window methods (Press et al., 2020), this approach doubles the cost of inference but improves results.
# 3
# Efficiency Analysis
# 3.1 Training Efficiency
# Attention The cost of attention in a transformer architecture for a sequence of length T has O(T 2 )
# complexity. Much work has been explored reducing this; for example, Sparse Transformers (Child
# et al., 2019) and Routing Transformers (Roy et al., 2020) show strong results with a complexity
# 3
# O(T 2 ). Many linear attention mechanisms have also been proposed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020;
# Choromanski et al., 2020), although we are not aware of competitive results on large scale language
# modeling tasks. As a function of sequence length T and patch size P , the Global model has a sequence
# 2
# of length PT so uses O( PT 2 ) operations, and the Local model uses PT sequences of length P so uses
# 2
# 2
# O( TPP ) = O(P T ) operations. The overall cost of M EGA B YTE is therefore in O( PT 2 + T P ). P is a
# 1
# hyperparameter that is chosen to create an architecture for sequences of size T . By setting P = T 3
# 4
# 1
# the complexity is in O(T 3 ). Using much shorter patches of P = T 5 would give a complexity of
# 8
# O(T 5 ). The cost is less than the transformer for all non-trivial values of P such that 1 < P < T .
# Feedforward Layers However, attention is not the main cost in large transformers. Instead of
# increasing the sequence length, transformers are more commonly scaled by increasing the dimension
# of their latent state d, and the feedforward network cost dominates the model’s overall cost (Kaplan
# et al., 2020). For example, in the GPT3 architecture, the quadratic self-attention computation accounts
# for only 1.4% of FLOPS. Following the approximation of (Kaplan et al., 2020), a forward pass with
# a large transformer with m non-embedding parameters on a sequence of length T uses roughly
# 2mT FLOPS. M EGA B YTE contains two transformers: the Global model uses mg parameters on a
# sequence of length PT , and a Local model with ml parameters that sees PT sequences of length P ,
# m
# giving an estimate of 2T ( Pg + ml ) FLOPS. When mg ≫ ml , the FLOPS used by M EGA B YTE is
# 2T m
# approximately P g , allowing a model P times larger than a transformer with equivalent FLOPS.
# This analysis holds irrespective of any efficient attention mechanisms used in the transformer.
# Combined Analysis To understand efficiency at different sequence lengths and model sizes,
# we calculate the total FLOPS used by transformers, Linear Transformers and M EGA B YTE. For
# each operation, we use FLOP estimates from (Kaplan et al., 2020), except for attention in Linear
# Transformers, which we estimate as 9D FLOPS/token1 , where D is the model embedding dimension.
# Figure 3 shows that for models of size 660M to 173B and sequence lengths of up to 1M tokens,
# 1
# This may underestimate the time taken by Linear Transformer decoders, which use a recurrence mechanism
# that is harder to parallelize on current hardware.
# 4M EGA B YTE with P = 8 uses less FLOPS than either transformers or Linear Transformers. Baseline
# model architectures are based on GPT3, and Megabyte global/local model sizes are 452M/151M,
# 5.8B/604M, 170B/3.2B respectively.
# 3.2
# Generation Efficiency
# Generating long sequences with transformers is
# slow, because the input to each timestep is the
# output from the previous timestep, meaning each
# layer must be computed for each token serially.
# As running a layer on a single token typically
# does not saturate the amount of parallelism avail-
# able within a GPU, for analysis, we model each
# layer as a constant cost independently of size.
# Consider a M EGA B YTE model with Lglobal lay-
# ers in the Global model and Llocal layers in the
# Local model and patch size P , compared with
# a Transformer architecture with Llocal + Lglobal
# layers. Generating each patch with M EGA B YTE
# requires a sequence of O(Lglobal + P · Llocal )
# serial operations, whereas the Transformer re-
# quires O(P ·Lglobal +P ·Llocal ) serial operations.
# When Lglobal ≫ Llocal (i.e. the Global model
# has many more layers than the Local model),
# M EGA B YTE can reduce inference costs by a
# factor close to P .
# 4
# Figure 3: Computational cost (FLOPS/token) for differ-
# ent model architectures at different scales. M EGA B YTE
# architectures (here with P = 8) use less FLOPS than
# equivalently sized Transformers and Linear Transform-
# ers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) across a wide range of
# model sizes and sequence lengths, allowing larger mod-
# els to be used for the same computational cost.
# Experimental setup
# Controlling for Compute and Data Models show consistent improvements when increasing
# both data and compute Kaplan et al. (2020); Hoffmann et al. (2022), meaning that one model can
# outperform another because of an increased training budget instead of an improved architecture.
# However, in practice, both compute and data are typically limited. We conduct experiments using a
# fixed compute and data budget across all models to focus comparisons solely on the model architecture
# rather than training resources. To achieve this, we adjust model hyperparameters (mainly, number of
# layers) within each architecture so that the forward pass time taken per byte is matched, and then
# train all models for the same number of bytes.
# Comparison Systems We compare M EGA B YTE with both a standard decoder-only Transformer
# and PerceiverAR (Hawthorne et al., 2022). PerceiverAR extends the original transformer with a
# single cross-attention layer over a much longer context sequence, and is the best performing general
# purpose autoregressive model we are aware of and achieves state-of-the-art results across several
# modalities. We implemented both models in the same codebase, and all models share a similar data
# loader, preprocessing step, and trainer to avoid any artifacts in our compute-controlled experiments.
# Training Procedure All models were trained using the Metaseq2 code base Zhang et al. (2022b).
# The training used the PyTorch framework Paszke et al. (2019), with fairscale to improve memory
# efficiency through fully sharded model and optimizer states Baines et al. (2021). Mixed precision
# training was used to improve training efficiency at scale Micikevicius et al. (2017). More training
# details and various model parameters can be found in Section A.1 in the Appendix. To validate
# our implementation of PerceiverAR, we reproduced their experiments on downsized ImageNet at
# 64 pixels. By carefully matching hyperparameters, we achieved a bits per byte (bpb) score of 3.53,
# compared to the reported 3.54 in the original paper.
# Inference Methods Several techniques have been proposed for trading off speed for performance
# during inference with language models, including sliding windows Press et al. (2020) and our strided
# inference. We only use these methods when comparing with prior published work (Tables 2 and 3).

# Language Modeling
# We evaluated the performance of M EGA B YTE on language modeling on a set of 5 diverse datasets
# emphasizing long-range dependencies: Project Gutenberg (PG-19), Books, Stories, arXiv, and Code.
# Datasets We experiment on a range of long form text datasets. The PG-19 dataset Rae et al. (2019b)
# consists of English-language books written before 1919 and is extracted from the Project Gutenberg
# online library. The Stories dataset Trinh & Le (2018) is a subset of CommonCrawl data meant to
# emulate Winograd schemas. Books Gao et al. (2020) is another collection of English-language books.
# The arXiv dataset contains technical publications written in LATEX from the arXiv online archive.
# Finally, the Code dataset is a large publicly available dataset of open source code, under Apache,
# BSD or MIT licenses. More details on dataset sizes and document lengths are shared in Table 1.
# Controlled Experiments Table 1 lists bpb on each dataset. Each model is trained for 80 billion bytes,
# and models are scaled to use the same compute budget. We carefully tune hyperparameters for all
# architectures to best utilize the available compute budget. M EGA B YTE consistently outperforms both
# transformers and PerceiverAR across all datasets. We use the same sets of parameters on all dataset.
# In all experiments presented in Table 1, transformer has size of 320M with context length of 1024,
# PerceiverAR has size of 248M with context size of 8192 and latent size of 1024, and M EGA B YTE
# global/local model sizes are 758M/262M with context length of 8192 and patch size of 8.
# Scaling Experiment We scale up our training data on PG-19 (Table 2), and compare M EGA B YTE
# with byte baselines, as well as converting all results to word-level perplexities to benchmark with state-
# of-art token based models. We train a byte-level Transformer, PerceiverAR and M EGA B YTE models
# for 400B bytes and the same compute budget using same model parameters as in the controlled
# experiments. We find that M EGA B YTE outperforms other byte-level models by a wide margin
# at this scale.3 We also compare with the best previously reported numbers for sub-word models.
# These results may be confounded by differing amounts of compute and tuning used, but show that
# M EGA B YTE gives results competitive with state-of-the-art models trained on subwords. These results
# suggest that M EGA B YTE may allow future large language models to be tokenization-free.

# Image Modeling
# Sequence Modeling on ImageNet We test M EGA B YTE on variants of the autoregressive image
# generation task on ImageNet (Oord et al., 2016), to measure its ability to efficiently use long context.
# We test on three different resolutions of images, ranging from 64×64 to 640×640 pixels – the latter
# 3
# The only prior byte-level experiments we are aware of are at a smaller scale in Hutchins et al. (2022), who
# report results equivalent to test perplexities of 46.5 with a version of the BlockRecurrent transformer, and 49.5
# with Memorizing Transformers Wu et al. (2022), compared to 36.4 with our model.
# 6requiring the effective modeling of sequences with over 1.2M tokens. This generation task becomes
# increasingly challenging as the image’s resolution grows: doing well on this task requires the modeling
# of local patterns (textures, lines, etc.) and long-range context that provides information about the
# high level structure of the image. Inspired by recent works in Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al.,
# 2020), we model image data patch by patch (more details can be found in Appendix D.1).
# Comparison with State of the Art We train a large M EGA B YTE model on ImageNet 64x64 with
# Global and Local models sized 2.7B and 350M parameters, respectively, for 1.4T tokens. We estimate
# that training this model consumed less than half the GPU hours we would have needed to reproduce
# the best PerceiverAR model described by (Hawthorne et al., 2022). As shown in Table 2, M EGA B YTE
# matches the state-of-the-art performance of PerceiverAR whilst using only half the compute.

# M EGA B YTE is able to handle all sequence lengths with a single forward pass of up to 1.2M tokens.
# We found neither the standard Transformer nor PerceiverAR could model such long sequences
# at a reasonable model size, so instead we split images into segments of size 1024 and 12000
# respectively. For Megabyte, we set patch size as 12 for Image64 and patch size as 192 for Image256
# and Image640 datasets. Model sizes are adjusted to match overall training speeds across models
# and we do not use any form of sliding window evaluation in this experiment. As seen in Table 4,
# M EGA B YTE outperforms baselines across all resolutions in this compute-controlled setting. The
# precise settings used for each of the baseline models such as context length and number of latents
# are summarized in Table 12. Results show that M EGA B YTE outperforms the other systems at all
# resolutions, demonstrating an effective model of sequences of over 1M bytes.

# Audio Modeling
# Audio has aspects of both the sequential structure of text and the continuous nature of images, so is
# an interesting application for M EGA B YTE.
# Raw audio is typically stored as a sequence of 16-bit integer values (one per timestep); a softmax layer
# would need to output 65,536 probabilities per timestep to model all possible values. To address this
# issue, various techniques have been developed to reduce the memory and computational requirements
# of the softmax layer. For instance, van den Oord et al. (2016) apply µ-law companding transformation
# and quantizes the input into 256 possible values. Alternatively, van den Oord et al. (2017) model the
# samples using the discretized mixture of logistics distribution introduced by Salimans et al. (2017).
# Finally, Kalchbrenner et al. (2018) use a dual softmax technique to produce 8 coarse and 8 fine bits.
# In our approach, we simplify the audio modeling process by directly reading the bytes (256 possible
# values) from the audio file and conducting an autoregressive language model on top of that. This
# greatly streamlines the modeling process, making it easier and more efficient.
# Our audio modeling approach focuses on 16 kHz, 16-bit audio, which equates to 32k bytes per
# one-second clip. We use an extensive audio dataset consisting of 2 terabytes (roughly 18,000 hours)
# of audio. We use a sequence length of 524,288, a patch size of 32, and a batch size of 32 to facilitate
# model training. By utilizing these settings, we can effectively train our model on large volumes of
# audio data, helping to improve its accuracy and efficacy. Our model obtains bpb of 3.477, much

# Analysis
# We study different behaviors of M EGA B YTE. All experiments in the same group use the same
# compute.
# Generation speed We also compare the text generation speed between M EGA B YTE and a trans-
# former. We compare a 350M parameter baseline transfomer and a M EGA B YTE model with a 1.3B
# parameter Global model and a 218M parameter local model, trained on PG19 with equal compute.
# As shown in Table 5, the M EGA B YTE model achieves much lower perplexity as expected. However,
# M EGA B YTE also generates a sequence of 8192 tokens 40% faster than transformer, despite having
# over 4 times the parameters. This speed up is due to the bulk of the parameters being in the Global
# model, which only needs to be computed once for every 8 tokens, whereas all the parameters in the
# baseline model are used on every token.
# Model Components In Table 6, we analyze the significance of different components in the
# M EGA B YTE architecture by studying arXiv, Librilight-L and ImageNet256 datasets. Removing Local
# (w/o local model) or global (w/o global model) model, we observe a substantial increase in bpb on all
# datasets, showing that both parts are crucial. The performance of the model without the cross-patch
# local model (w/o cross-patch local model) is competitive, indicating that the architecture is robust to
# this modification. We observe slight improvement on the Librilight-L and ImageNet256 datasets by
# augmenting the M EGA B YTE model with a CNN encoder (w/ CNN encoder). This suggests that the
# M EGA B YTE architecture can benefit from integrating alternative encoding mechanisms.
# Effective Use of Context Long-context models often struggle to benefit from the full context (Sun
# et al., 2021). Figure 7 shows that later tokens within each context window have a higher likelihood,
# indicating that M EGA B YTE can effectively use at least 8k bytes of context on the PG19 dataset.

# M EGA B YTE model.Strided Inference We find that within a single patch, on average, the M EGA B YTE performs worse

# where two forward passes are performed offset by P2 tokens, and results from the first half of each

# Patch Size. We experimented with various patch sizes on Image256 dataset and found a wide range

# Local to Global model Size Ratio. We experimented with different Local/Global model size ratios

# for the Global model as on the Local model—enabling us to increase the size of the Global model
# with reduced cost. We find that a given compute budget is spent optimally when the Global model is
# larger than the Local model, consistently across all modalities and various patch sizes.

# Related Work
# Prior research has explored the possibility of improving the efficiency of Transformers on long
# sequences, primarily motivated by mitigating the quadratic cost of self-attention.
# Efficient Encoder Models Several related techniques to ours have been developed for transformer
# encoder architectures but cannot be straightforwardly applied to decoders. In particular, patchifying
# operations have previously been used in image encoder models such as ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020),
# and down- and up-sampling operations have been used for text encoders (Clark et al., 2022), but such
# methods cannot be naively applied to decoder-only models without leaking information to future
# bytes in the same patch. M EGA B YTE generalizes these approaches to an efficient decoder model
# by using a intra-patch transformer to predict each sequence element’s likelihood, and offseting the
# inputs to the two models to avoid leaking information. Jaegle et al. (2021) use self-attention on a
# shorter latent sequence also resembles patchification, but this technique cannot easily be applied to
# decoder architectures without leaking information to future timesteps.
# Efficient Decoder models Improving the efficiency of decoder models is harder because of the need
# to make one prediction per timestep, and not leak information to future timesteps. The most popular
# approaches can be categorized as (1) chunking sequences into smaller blocks, and propagating
# information from previous blocks with either recurrence (Dai et al., 2019; Hutchins et al., 2022) or
# cross-attention (Hawthorne et al., 2022), (2) linear alternatives to attention, which typically involve
# forms of token-level recurrence (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) or state space models (Gu et al., 2021;
# Smith et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022), or (3) sparse approximations of attention (Kitaev et al., 2020;
# Beltagy et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2022). However, the performance of dense attention
# means it is typically still chosen for large scale decoders (Touvron et al., 2023; Chowdhery et al.,
# 2022). M EGA B YTE takes the alternative approach of decomposing the complete sequence into two
# shorter sequences, giving sub-quadratic attention. We also note that feedforward networks are the
# dominant cost in large decoders, not self-attention. Our approach to compressing sequences allows
# much larger models than would be possible when using large feedforward networks at every timestep.
# Tokenization The most common approach to shortening sequence lengths in Transformer decoders is
# to pre-process the input with a form of tokenization, in which multiple bytes are mapped to a single
# discrete token from a fixed vocabulary. For text, this can be done losslessly using methods such as
# BPE (Sennrich et al., 2015) and SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018), but these approaches can
# require language-specific heuristics (Radford et al., 2019), limit out-of-domain performance (Sharami
# 9et al., 2023), and can affect prompting and truncated sampling in unpredictable ways.4 The amount
# of high-frequency information in images and audio means that tokenization cannot be performed
# losslessly, and instead clustering (Hsu et al., 2021) or discrete auto-encoders (Ramesh et al., 2021) are
# used to compress the inputs, which lose information and likely limit generative model performance.
# Our patches are analogous to traditional lossless tokens, and the Local model performs the role of
# mapping a hidden state to a distribution over possible patches.

# Conclusion
# We introduced M EGA B YTE, a scaleable architecture for modeling long sequences. M EGA B YTE
# outperforms existing byte-level models across a range of tasks and modalities, allowing large models
# of sequences of over 1 million tokens. It also gives competitive language modeling results with
# subword models, which may allow byte-level models to replace tokenization. However, the scale
# of experiments here is far below those of state-of-the-art language models (Brown et al., 2020), and
# future work should explore scaling M EGA B YTE to much larger models and datasets.

# A.1Training Details
# To ensure stable training, we applied gradient clipping with a maximum norm of 1.0 and used the
# Adam optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 Kingma & Ba (2015). We used the built-in polynomial
# decay learning rate scheduler in MetaSeq with 500 warmup updates and the end learning rate set
# to 0. All models are trained with pre-norm and using ReLU activation. We apply a dropout of 0.1
# throughout, but we do not apply any dropout to embeddings. We also use weight decay of 0.1. To
# initialize the weights, we use a variant based on Megatron-LM codebase, which involves using a
# normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 0.006. We truncate this normal
# distribution within two standard deviations and observed substantial gain in both training stability
# and performance.
# A.2
# Motivation
# Why is the local model needed? Many of the efficiency advantages of the M EGA B YTE design could
# be realized with the Global model alone, which would resemble a decoder version of ViT (Dosovitskiy
# et al., 2020). However, the joint distribution over the patch p(xt+1 , .., xt+P |x0..t ) has an output space
# of size 256P so direct modeling is only tractable for very small patches. We could instead factor
# the joint distribution into conditionally independent distributions p(xt+1 |x0..t )..p(xt+P |x0..t ), but
# this would greatly limit the model’s expressive power. For example, it would be unable to express
# a patch distribution such as 50% cat and 50% dog, and would instead have to assign probability
# mass to strings such as cag and dot. Instead, our autoregressive Local model conditions on previous
# characters within the patch, allowing it to only assign probability to the desired strings.
# Increasing Parameters for Fixed Compute Transformer models have shown consistent improve-
# ments with parameter counts (Kaplan et al., 2020). However, the size of models is limited by their
# increasing computational cost. M EGA B YTE allows larger models for the same cost, both by mak-
# ing self attention sub-quadratic, and by using large feedforward layers across patches rather than
# individual tokens.
# Re-use of Established Components M EGA B YTE consists of two transformer models interleaved
# with shifting, reshaping and a linear projection. This re-use increases the likelihood that the architec-
# ture will inherit the desirable scaling properties of transformers.
# A.3
# Model Details
# As discussed in Section 4, we conduct experiments using a fixed compute and data budget across all
# models to focus our comparisons solely on the model architecture rather than training resources. To
# achieve this, we adjust model hyperparameters within each architecture so that the time taken for a
# single update is matched and then train all models for the same number of updates. We list all of
# model details in Table 12 and Table 13.

# Table 13: Model architecture details. We report the model size, the embedding size (D), number of layaers(L),
# total batch size (BS), learning rate(LR), and context length. When we vary the number of model layers from the
# standard amount for the given size (Table 12), we note this accordingly. For PerceiverAR models, we note the
# number of latents used, and for M EGA B YTE models we note the patch sizes.

# PerceiverAR Implementation
# To reproduce PerceiverAR in a compute-controlled setting we extended the standard transformer
# implementation in metaseq with an additonal cross attention layer to compute the latents and match
# the architecture of PerceiverAR. We trained the model by sampling random spans from each text,
# matching the procedure used in the PerceiverAR codebase. To be consistent with the original work,
# we use sliding window evaluation with a stride of num_latents/2 unless otherwise noted. In several
# cases we used the standard metaseq implementation as opposed to specific techniques reported in
# the original paper: 1) we used standard attention dropout instead of cross-attention dropout 2) We
# did not implement chunked attention. We verified our implementation by reproducing the "Standard
# Ordering" experiments in Table 5 of the Perceiver AR paper. After carefully matching context size,
# number of latents, the amount of data and training steps used and learning rate, we achieved 3.53 bpb
# vs 3.54 reported in the original paper.

# D.1Patch scan Implementation
# Images have a natural structure, containing a grid of n × n pixels each composed of 3 bytes
# (corresponding to color channels). We explore two ways of converting images to sequences for
# modeling (see Figure 4). Firstly, raster scan where the pixels are linearized into 3 bytes and
# concatenated row-by-row. Secondly, patch scan where we create patches of shape p × p × 3 bytes
# 15Figure 4: Two ways to model 2D data sequentially. Left, raster scan, by taking bytes row by row and left to
# right; right, patch scan, where we first split an image into patches, and do raster scan across patches and within a
# patch. (T=36, K=9, P=4).
# q
# P
# where p =
# 3 , and then use a raster scan both within and between patches. Unless otherwise
# specified, M EGA B YTE models use patch scan for image data.
# D.2
# Patch scan vs Raster scan
# The patch scan method is inspired by recent works in Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020),
# and it is more effective than raster scan for modeling image sequencing. We found it improves both
# M EGA B YTE and Perceiver AR.

# Longer sequence modeling
# For our pg19 scaling experiment, we also use longer context length for M EGA B YTE. The results are
# shown in Table 15. With longer sequence, we didn’t observer further improvement, consistent with
# findings in Hawthorne et al. (2022). We think we will benefit more from longer sequence when we
# futher scale up the model size and data.
